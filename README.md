# Lakshmi Pranathi Vutla   
Active graduate student @ UMass Boston • Co-founder of **AI Fantastic** • Builder of smart, creative systems that connect **AI + IoT + Full-Stack + Agents**  

I’m currently exploring **Recommendation Systems with Explainable AI**, developing projects through **AI Fantastic**, and experimenting with **interactive WebGL graphics** and **autonomous agents**.  
Curious mind, aesthetic coder — I love turning ideas into experiences that feel alive ✨

### 🌟 What I’m Working On
- Building **explainable recommendation systems** that blend reasoning with personalization.  
- Developing IoT-driven and full-stack prototypes that make AI practical.  
- Expanding **AI Fantastic**, a student-led research & creativity hub for intelligent systems.  
- Creating **agent-based tools** that help users learn and interact more intuitively.

### 🧠 Achievements & Projects
- 🧩 **Knowledge Distillation in Image Classification** — teacher–student CNNs combining real + synthetic data.  
- 🎨 **AI for All (Image Colorization)** — reviving grayscale images using deep learning.  
- 🌀 **Explainable Movie Recommender System** — hybrid LightFM + NCF with LIME & SHAP insights.  
- 💡 **IoT + Cybersecurity Projects** — automatic power-off and energy-aware smart plugs.  
- 🌈 **Graphics & WebGL Experiments** — visual art meets code: WebGPU demos and 3D scenes.

### 🌱 A little about me
I love connecting logic with aesthetics — whether that’s designing neural systems that **explain themselves**, creating intuitive **visual interfaces**, or prototyping smart **IoT agents**.  
Co-founding **AI Fantastic** has made me believe AI research can be fun, social, and beautifully interactive 🌼
